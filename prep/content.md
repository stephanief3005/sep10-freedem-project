  * It also has a scale to detect if this person's teeth health is good
* A medicine for wisdom teeth after procedures to remove them

  * connected with an app on your phone

  * Long-lasting battery life
  * You place the tiny machine next to the tooth gap you wanna gloss. You have to place it well, and it turns green, and it starts flossing and doing the movement to floss that gap of your teeth, so all you have to do is hold it.
  * You have to change the string after using it for hygiene purposes.

# Entry 3: Dental Health and Technology
##### 12/1/25

So, what I've brainstormed for possible future technology is a cleaner scanner for teeth, so it can be used for personal and professional use. They use this scanner, which has this type of light that detects most parts that need cleaning by showing colors, detecting how much bacteria it has. Another future technology I brainstormed was a tiny machine that helps you floss much faster. You place the tiny machine next to the tooth gap you wanna floss. You have to place it well, and it turns green, and it starts flossing and doing the movement to floss that gap of your teeth, so all you have to do is hold it, with a long-lasting battery, etc Lastly, a medicine for wisdom teeth after procedures to remove them this can help people who always go through a lot of pain after getting their wisdom teeth removed. I finalized all of my content by making sure



### Sources
I didn't use any sources, but I used Google's search engine to find out if the possible future technology for dental health exists. So I would write it off on a paper of my ideas, then I would search for example "Does a machine flosser exist" or "A medicine for wisdom tooth pain," and so the ideas that aren't yet made, I add them to my part B (Possible future technology) information.

### Edp
Right now, I am finalizing all of my FP content. My plans for the next stage are to plan the solution for informing people about dental health technology apps, sources, and any type of technology to be made known. So I am hoping to be organized for my plan and to know the exact steps and have a great performance in my next steps. :)

### Skills
The skills I've learned are to have a better growth mindset. So I've always been doubting myself based on the grades I've been getting in my blog and write-ups, thinking I'm gonna get something wrong that which just affected everything I do in work in SEP, and I always have the thought that I will have a bad grade. But all I need to do is learn from my mistakes and become more positive. If I fail, that's okay, I learn from it and become better.

## The process of getting into my chosen topic: Dental Hygeine
  Throughout the time of researching software and hardware technologies for my topic dental hygeine was, I discovered more about dental radiograph and got to learn what the stuff your dental hygeinst use. I was really curious on why they always used this chewy plastic flat cube paper and tell me to stay still and they would scan that pose and would go to through every part of my teeth. I soon discovered in this website https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/11199-dental-x-rays?utm_source= says that this process of dental radiograph is where they use a bite chewing tab that can also be a sensor holder to keep the digital sensor ready to use. And with those scans they recieve and then put in their computers they can use it to detect cavities or bone loss. I don't know about you but that sounds really cool. But the part of staying still uncomftorably // with this plastic thing in your teeth isn't haha! Whats great is this way of dental radiograph is good since its the top one's who use low radiation.

## The process of getting into my chosen topic: Dental Hygeine
  Throughout the time of researching software and hardware technologies for my topic dental hygeine was, I discovered more about dental radiograph and got to learn what the stuff your dental hygeinst use. I was really curious on why they always used this chewy plastic flat cube paper and tell me to stay still and they would scan that pose and would go to through every part of my teeth. I soon discovered in this website https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/11199-dental-x-rays?utm_source= says that this process of dental radiograph is where they use a bite chewing tab that can also be a sensor holder to keep the digital sensor ready to use. And with those scans they recieve and then put in their computers they can use it to detect cavities or bone loss. I don't know about you but that sounds really cool. But the part of staying still uncomftorably // with this plastic thing in your teeth isn't haha! Whats great is this way of dental radiograph is good since its the top one's who use low radiation. Ok now aside from it's hardware technologies lets get into software. So during my research in dental software I found a software called **dentrix** I looked into their website https://www.henryscheinone.com/products/dentrix-ascend/?utm_source=capterra&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=dtxa-promo-capterra&tname=2025-08-digital-ad-dtxa-promo-capterra&gdmcid=f6992493-fa0a-43d5-8dbc-5ad0acf7c740 and its known to be designed to streamline adminestrative and clinical work flows in a dental office. So basically it helps a dental clinic keep order and help manage with everything. It helps them access to their partients information like insurance coverage details changes and etc... making their jobs more easier. This is a good software in my opinion because it helps them perform their job more better by having dentrix helping them be organized and know what to do. Like a app that tells you what things to do and it has quick assesibility// to get into information.

## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
Well I am curently in the second stage of my engineer design process of researching to help people know more about technology that exists in the dental field. So during this stage I'm in I think its great to go in depth of the technologies that are used everytime we go to the dentist and we are there wondering what they are but. Not only that but research the other different types of software and hardware technologies used in every day dental clinic life.

# Skills!
Ok so the skills I've learned working on this blog are time management, and authenticity. Ok first lets talk about time management. So I developed this skill when I was researching software and hardware technologies. I was focusing on researching stuff in the dental field that weren't really important like electric teeth cleaners and common stuff but, what I needed to focus on was about **technolgies** that people did not know. Which is the problem I'm going to get a solution. So i learned that first I should prioritize and focus what's important and get it done. And then, on my free time I can check the low priorities! Now lets get into authenticity during my research in google I saw theese websites that weren't clearly answering my searching that I was looking for when I wrote it. What was frustraiting was it was hard to tell if they were legit or not. So what i did is I checked if they were verrified clinics and organizations and that's how I got to collecting my information more confidently.

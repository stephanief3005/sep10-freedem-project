# Entry 1
##### X/X/XX

I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **dental hygiene**. I have always found myself to be clean and organized, and I enjoy helping others feel confident and secure about themselves. It was nice to see what great impacts ["dental hygienist lead to"](https://jdh.adha.org/content/99/5/4) by the American Dental Hygienist Association.  So when I discovered the profession of a dental hygienist, it instantly caught most of my attention.  
I like that dental hygienists play an important role in keeping people healthy. It's not all about cleaning teeth, but it's essential to teach patients how to take care of their smiles. To add on, I especially like that it's a hands-on job. I like socializing with new people every day and helping them keep their teeth healthy.
Another reason this career caught my attention. My backup ideas were business and fashion, but I feel like I have more knowledge on the topic I mainly chose.

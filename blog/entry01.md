# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Dental Health and Technology)
##### 10/11/25


## Choosing a topic
The topic I chose was *Dental Health and its technologies* because, most of the time, I have remembered since I was younger, and now. I was so curious about teeth and why they were so important. Then grew into questions like how do these technologies do this and that. I am mostly interested in the healthcare field. My backup idea was doing a full health involving the whole body. But hey, that seems a lot to learn. So why not choose something a bit simpler? Another reason is that I remember I would always ask the dentist who attended me what this technology does, and I seemed pretty interested. When I hear the word technology, what instantly comes to my mind are those machines that people in health care use, for example, patient monitors. Those X-rays are used for teeth and bones in your body. Which I also connect to computers cause that's what they use to see it

Now the two main links I used to explore my topic were ["Technology in dentistry, Through the Ages](https://dental.nyu.edu/aboutus/history/technology-in-dentistry-through-the-ages.html) by NYU, and [](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4209425/) by NIH stands for National Library of Medicine. The first link gave me an informative view on how Dentistry has evolved from medieval practitioners using specialized instruments. To know what we have these advanced digital technologies! With these helpful achievements, like drills called **Propel**, fluoride, implants, and preventive support. Now on the second link also talks about advancements, such as the changes in traditional 2D X-rays to these new modern 3D technologies like MRI scans and ultrasound, that helped improve the quality of life for their patients, especially with early detection and treatment.

## Engineer design process
I am currently at the stage of choosing the topic on which I want to mainly choose on. So there is nothing much done right now. But after we do more in-depth research on the topic!


## Skills
Skills I learned are how to be ready to take opportunities and why, and my second skill is how to get authentic information from **trustworthy websites**.

### Taking opportunities
The reason why I developed the skill of taking opportunities is that I remember exploring around our class, reading opportunities, and what it helped people learn and help them with. We would stick post-its on a big white paper or write what we learned. Another activity that helped was a lesson called **Opportunity Essay Prep**. First, we work with examples and fix them. We highlight and explain what they should fix. Then we make our own one using an example question, so it gave me quite an experience, and thanks to the guidance, and then we put everything together, it's actually not that bad. This will help me in the future to take the chance on taking opportunities with knowing how to.

### Trustworthy websites
So during class, it was **always**, mentioned that when we are finding information from the internet, for example, on Google, the most trustworthy websites are the links that end with: gov, org, edu. Not that .com is unsafe, but it is a better option. That will be kept in mind now when I am googling for a good use to get real information and not waste time.

## Summary
To summarize, I am very excited to use my time and dedication to learn about my topic, and I hope to use this to kind of get a hint of how I can use this information for my future career, also :).

I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **dental hygiene**. I have always found myself to be clean and organized, and I enjoy helping others feel confident and secure about themselves. It was nice to see the great impacts ["dental hygienist help us lead on"](https://jdh.adha.org/content/99/5/4) in an article by the American Dental Hygienist Association. Especially with the ["role technology"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10093858/) it has, and how ["important it is itself"](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/oral-hygiene) Article's by NIH. So when I discovered the profession of a dental hygienist, it instantly caught most of my attention.  
I appreciate that dental hygienists play a crucial role in maintaining people's health. It's not all about cleaning teeth, but it's essential to teach patients how to take care of their smiles. To add on, I especially like that it's a hands-on job. I like socializing with new people every day and helping them keep their teeth healthy.
Another reason this career caught my attention. My backup ideas were business and fashion, but I feel like I have more knowledge on the topic I mainly chose.

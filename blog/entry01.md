# SEP10 Freedom Project
# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Dental Health and Technology)
##### 10/11/25


## Choosing a topic
The topic I chose was Dental Health and its technologies because, most of the time, I have remembered since I was younger, and now. I was so curious about teeth and why they were so important. Then grew into questions like how do these technologies do this and that. I am mostly interested in the healthcare field. My backup idea was doing full health involving the whole body. But hey, that seems a lot to learn. So why not choose something a bit simpler? Another reason is that I remember I would always ask the dentist who attended me what does this technology does and how I seemed pretty interested. When I hear the word technology, what instantly comes to my mind are those machines that people in health care use, for example, patient monitors. Those X-rays are used for teeth and bones in your body. Which I also connect to computers cause that's what they use to see it

Now the two main links I used to explore my topic was




## Engineer design process
I am currently at the stage of choosing the topic on which I want to mainly choose on


## Skills
Skills I learned are how to be ready to take opportunities and why, my second skill is how to get authentic information from trustworthy webs.

I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project that focuses on our current and future innovations in a topic of our choice.

For my project, I chose the topic of **dental hygiene**. I have always been interested in cleanliness and organization, and I enjoy helping others feel confident about themselves. When I read  [" The role of Dental Hygienists in Modern healthcare"](https://jdh.adha.org/content/99/5/4) by the American Dental Hygienist Association. I was impressed by how dental hygienists use technology to improve patient care. Especially another article I found by the NIH  ["the role of technology in oral health"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10093858/) it has, and how ["important it is itself"](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/oral-hygiene) Articles by NIH. So when I discovered the profession of a dental hygienist, it instantly caught most of my attention.  
I appreciate that dental hygienists play a crucial role in maintaining people's health. It's not all about cleaning teeth, but it's essential to teach patients how to take care of their smiles. To add on, I especially like that it's a hands-on job. I like socializing with new people every day and helping them keep their teeth healthy.
Another reason this career caught my attention. My backup ideas were business and fashion, but I feel like I have more knowledge on the topic I mainly chose.
